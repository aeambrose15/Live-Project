# Live-Project

The Live Project that I completed at The Tech Academy, focused on making a software program for user scheduling and time clocking. It is a program to track employee's schedules, work periods, requested time off and pay. After a user submits a request, an Admin is able to review it and determine if the user's request is approved or denied. The snippets included highlight some of the work I did on this project over a two week period.
